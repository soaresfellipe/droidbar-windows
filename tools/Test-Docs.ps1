# Test-Docs.ps1 - keeps AGENTS.md and README.md honest.
#
# Documentation drifts silently: a gate gets renamed, a file moves, a link
# rots, and the docs keep describing a workflow that no longer exists. This
# script fails CI on the three failure modes that actually happen in this repo:
#
#   1. A path mentioned in AGENTS.md / README.md that does not exist in the repo.
#   2. A local Markdown link whose target does not exist.
#   3. A fenced PowerShell block whose first command line references a missing
#      path (cheap guard against docs advertising deleted scripts).
#
# It does not try to validate prose or external URLs (network in CI is slow and
# flaky); scope is "does what the docs point at still exist".
#
# Usage: pwsh -File tools/Test-Docs.ps1
